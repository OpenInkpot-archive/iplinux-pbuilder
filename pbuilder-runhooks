# Title:         pbuilder-runhooks
# Description    User hooks for pbuilder package
# Programmed by: Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>

# $HOOKDIR is set in /etc/pbuilderrc and contains a list of executable
# programs or scripts. The type is only limited by what you expect will
# be available in your chrooted environment after debootstrap has done
# an initial install. The functions muxt be named in the format:
# <prefex><digit><digit><descriptive name>. Currently only X is defined;
# scripts prefixed with X will be run just before the chroot environment
# is exited and the base.tgz file is created or updated.

# $BUILDPLACE is as used in pbuilder. When already inside chroot, this
# routine can be called with $BUILDPLACE='' (from pdebuild-internal)

# TODO:		* Are there any other executable backup types we should
#		  filtered besides *~ and *.bak?
